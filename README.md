# Invite

Invite is a landing page for events. 

Invite is created with a React with Redux frontend and a Rails API backend with a PostgreSQL database. Please find the Invite client repository [here](https://github.com/natjng/invite-client).

Users can sign up or login with their email address to start using Invite. Users can host events by creating an event and be an event guest by RSVPing to other users' events.

## Installation

Clone repository. 

In your terminal, cd to the cloned file. 

Run `bundle install`, `rails db:create`, and `rails db:migrate`. 

You may also run `rails db:seed` to seed the database with some starter data.

Run `rails s` to start your server and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

The Invite API works with the [Invite client](https://github.com/natjng/invite-client) to retrieve and persist user and event data. Please follow the Invite client README for installation instructions.

On the home page, a user can get started by creating an account with an email address. 

Upon successful account creation, the user will be logged in and brought to their dashboard where they can choose to create a new event or view existing events. 

## Features

- The user creating the event is the event host
